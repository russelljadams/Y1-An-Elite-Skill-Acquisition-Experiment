Experiment overview: 0 → elite GT3 sim-racing skill in 1 year

This is a deliberate-practice experiment with one core claim:

If you constrain variables hard enough and train with real feedback loops long enough, skill growth stops being "mysterious talent" and starts looking like engineering.

You're not trying to "get faster." You're trying to measure what's possible when a motivated adult commits to a controlled, high-volume, high-quality training program—then documents it publicly like it's a case study.

The premise (what you're actually testing)
Working hypothesis

With 1,200+ hours of properly structured deliberate practice, you can compress years of normal sim-racing development into one year—especially if you:

Eliminate novelty churn (new cars/tracks every week)

Train fundamentals that transfer to real-world GT3 racing

Measure repeatability, not just a hero lap

Persist past boredom (the real wall)

Structure practice using research-backed motor learning science

The deeper point

Most people "practice" by driving lots of laps while their brain is half-asleep. Your experiment is:
What happens if practice is treated like a lab protocol instead of entertainment?

The real-world goal

This isn't just a sim experiment. GT3 has an actual career pathway—gentleman driver programs, factory-backed teams, real endurance series (GTWC, IMSA, WEC). Team RedLine has bridged sim-to-real. Max Verstappen has spoken about taking a practically nobody sim racer to the real world. The Porsche 911 Cup Car is the gateway: Porsche Carrera Cup is literally the feeder to factory GT programs.

The experiment is proof of concept. The data trail is the resume.

The experimental design (your constraints are the power)
1) One car: Porsche 911 GT3 Cup

The 911 Cup Car is the one-make series standard. It's what you race in Porsche Carrera Cup, Porsche Supercup, and Porsche Esports Supercup. Choosing it means:

Every hour of practice directly maps to the car used in the real-world feeder series.

It's a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive car that punishes lazy throttle application and rewards precise weight transfer management.

No downforce crutch—you build laps from mechanical grip, not aero.

The car is unforgiving enough to expose bad habits, but predictable enough to reward deliberate refinement.

This is about choosing the tool that has a real-world career path, not just the cleanest learning signal.

2) Four fixed tracks (locked)

The environment is limited to four tracks for the full 12 months. But the scheduling follows research-backed motor learning science.

Why four tracks:

Skill comes from pattern recognition + motor precision, not tourism.

Rotating tracks constantly resets the learning curve and inflates the feeling of "progress."

A small set enables variance collapse (you stop being sometimes-fast and become reliably-fast).

Schmidt's schema theory (1975): practicing the same skill class under varied conditions builds stronger generalized motor programs than grinding one track. Each track parameterizes braking, cornering, and throttle differently—variation strengthens the abstract rules governing all racing skill.

The four tracks:

Spa-Francorchamps — elevation changes, Eau Rouge commitment, every corner type. On the Porsche Supercup, GTWC Endurance Cup, and iRacing 24h calendar. Team RedLine's backyard.

Monza — extreme braking from 300+ kph into tight chicanes, low-downforce setup discipline. Porsche Supercup season finale, GTWC Endurance Cup. The polar opposite of Spa.

Nürburgring GP — balanced mid-speed flowing sections with elevation. GTWC Endurance Cup. Verstappen and Team RedLine won the iRacing 24 Hours here.

Barcelona — the test track. Sustained high-speed corners, tire management, setup compromise. Porsche Supercup + GTWC both years (5 combined calendar appearances, highest of any track).

All appear on real-world Porsche Supercup or GTWC Europe calendars. Every braking zone type covered. Every speed range covered. Elevation variety from dramatic (Spa) to flat (Monza).

3) Three-phase practice scheduling (increasing contextual interference)

This is the key methodological innovation over the original experiment design. The scheduling follows Porter & Magill (2010), which showed that gradually increasing contextual interference beat both pure blocked AND pure interleaved practice.

Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3) — Primarily blocked (~70% focused, 30% mixed)

Spend 2-3 week concentrated blocks on each track to build the basic cognitive map, reference points, and motor representation. Corner isolation and active reset are the primary tools. Run a Baseline 25 at the end of each track's initial block.

Rationale: Magill & Hall (1990) showed blocked practice is superior when tasks are highly complex and the learner is a novice at each task. You need an initial motor representation before the forgetting-reconstruction mechanism can operate.

Phase 2: Increasing interference (Months 4-7) — Serial rotation (~40% focused, 60% rotating)

Predictable weekly rotation across all 4 tracks. Each week hits all 4, but sessions are still single-track. Variance-driven weighting: tracks with higher stddev get extra sessions.

Rationale: Shea & Morgan (1979) showed that inter-task comparisons forced by mixing produce more elaborate and distinctive memory traces. The elaboration-distinctiveness hypothesis: multiple motor representations active simultaneously in working memory forces cross-task learning.

Phase 3: Full interleaving (Months 8-12) — Random/mixed (~80%+ interleaved)

Random track ordering within and across days. Multi-track days. Race simulations enter the mix. Equal time unless one track is dramatically harder.

Rationale: The forgetting-reconstruction hypothesis (Lee & Magill, 1983): switching tasks forces you to "forget" the action plan, then reconstruct it when returning. Each reconstruction strengthens the memory trace. By Phase 3, all four track representations are robust enough to benefit from this mechanism. Taubert et al. (2019) showed alternating is near-optimal once basic competence is established.

4) Session structure (based on Ericsson's volume findings)

Daily maximum: 2-3 hours across 2 sessions of 60-90 minutes each. Ericsson (1993) found 4 hours/day was the general limit for sustained deliberate practice, but perceptual-motor skills may peak closer to 2-3 hours.

Session gap: 1-2 hours minimum between sessions. Elite performers in Ericsson's studies napped between sessions.

Recovery: At least 1 full rest day per week. Sleep is non-negotiable—Walker et al. (2002) showed a single night of sleep produced 17-20% motor speed improvement that more practice could not replicate. Doubling session length does NOT amplify overnight consolidation gains.

Spacing: Sessions distributed across days beat the same volume crammed into one day. Each sleep cycle is a consolidation opportunity (Shea et al., 2000).

5) Warm tires define "practice"

The outlap/cold-tire chaos is its own category. Core practice begins when tires are warm enough that laps are reproducible.

6) Training volume: 1,200+ hours in 12 months

Target: 100 hours/month (90h floor). That's the headline constraint. But the real constraint is: those hours must be high-quality reps.

This experiment dies if the hours become "vibes laps."

What you're trying to achieve (concrete outcomes)
Outcome A: Elite pace on the locked combo

Not "I can do one good lap."
Aiming for sustained proximity to top benchmarks on each of the four tracks in the 911 Cup Car.

The signature of success:

Smaller and smaller gap to strong references

Fewer "where did THAT come from?" laps

Faster recovery after mistakes

Consistent execution across sessions, not just within a session

Outcome B: Variance collapse (your real superpower)

Elite drivers are scary because they're not random.

Training toward:

Sector times that stop swinging wildly

Braking points that don't drift

Minimum speeds that stabilize

Fewer corrective steering inputs

Cleaner brake releases (less "binary," more shaped)

This is the difference between fast and weaponized.

Outcome C: Transferable GT3 fundamentals

The goal is not to become a specialist who only knows one combo. It's to build fundamentals that transfer to any GT3 machinery on any track:

Braking judgment (initial hit + pressure shaping)

Brake release into rotation (trail braking with purpose)

Minimum speed discipline

Throttle timing (earlier without sliding)

Line construction under constraints

Weight transfer management (rear-engine specific)

The 911 Cup Car phase builds the driver. The data proves it.

Outcome D: Real-world pathway validation

The experiment exists in the context of a viable career path. Success means:

Demonstrable pace data on tracks that real teams actually race on

Variance metrics that prove consistency, not just speed

A public data trail that functions as a portfolio/resume

Visibility to organizations like Team RedLine who bridge sim-to-real

Outcome E: Public documentation as accountability + proof

The documentation isn't fluff—it's part of the experimental integrity:

Building a visible trail of evidence

Making it harder to "quietly move the goalposts"

Turning the journey into something other people can learn from

What makes this "deliberate practice" instead of "a lot of driving"

This is the hard line:

Driving laps

High volume

Low intention

Mood-based

Improvement is accidental

Deliberate practice

One narrow skill at a time

Tight feedback loop (telemetry, reference laps, notes)

Reps until the nervous system actually changes

Boring on purpose

The protocol:

Identify a specific weakness (not "I'm slow," but where and why)

Create a drill that isolates it

Repeat until it stabilizes

Re-test in full laps

Log results and adjust

How you'll know you succeeded (success criteria)

A good experiment has pass/fail signals that don't rely on vibes.

The year worked if most of these are true:

Your lap times improve and your bad laps get dramatically better (variance collapse)

You can return after a day off and be near pace quickly (retention)

You can explain why a lap was fast in concrete terms (understanding)

Your performance holds under pressure (races, traffic, imperfect conditions)

A different track doesn't break you—it reveals the same fundamentals still work (transfer)

Competitive in Porsche Esports Supercup-level lobbies

The honest risks (things that can ruin it)

Constraint drift: "just this one new car/track" turns into dilution.

Ego chasing: hunting peak laps instead of building repeatability.

Garbage miles: hours logged without tight feedback loops.

Sleep debt: nervous-system learning gets kneecapped if recovery is consistently bad.

Injury/burnout: physical (wrists/back/neck) or mental (stagnation panic).

Phase discipline: jumping to Phase 3 scheduling before foundations are solid.

The experiment requires not just intensity, but discipline under boredom.

Prologue: The SFL phase (January 2-February 13, 2026)

The experiment originally launched with the Super Formula Lights on four formula tracks (Monza, Silverstone, Suzuka, Spa). 113 hours were logged across 311 sessions before the pivot to GT3.

Why the pivot: Formula sim racing has no viable real-world career pathway. GT3 does. The SFL phase served as a proof of concept for the methodology (high-volume deliberate practice, corner isolation, variance tracking) and a warm-up for the infrastructure (telemetry parser, dashboard, baseline protocol). The methodology carries forward. The car and tracks change.

SFL phase data is archived, not deleted. It demonstrated that the training infrastructure works and that 100+ hour months are sustainable.
