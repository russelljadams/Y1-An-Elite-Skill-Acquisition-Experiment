An Elite Skill Acquisition Experiment. A 1200-Hour Case Study in Deliberate Practice.

## the experiment

Can elite-level GT3 skill be engineered through constrained, high-volume deliberate practice? This is a public documentation of that question being tested — with the explicit goal of bridging sim-to-real GT3 racing.

## parameters

```
duration:      12 months (Feb 2026 – Feb 2027)
target_hours:  1,200+ (100h/month, 90h floor)
car:           Porsche 911 GT3 Cup
tracks:        4 (locked)
  - Spa-Francorchamps
  - Monza
  - Nürburgring GP
  - Barcelona
domain:        iRacing sim racing
scheduling:    3-phase increasing contextual interference
```

## hypothesis

Skill acquisition follows predictable patterns when variables are constrained and feedback loops are tight. This experiment tests whether deliberate practice methodology — structured using motor learning research (Ericsson, Porter & Magill, Schmidt schema theory) — produces measurable elite-level improvement in a 12-month window.

## why GT3

Formula sim racing has no viable real-world career path. GT3 does. Porsche Carrera Cup is the direct feeder to factory GT programs. Team RedLine bridges sim-to-real. The tracks in this experiment appear on actual Porsche Supercup and GTWC Europe calendars. The data trail is the resume.

## prologue

The experiment launched Jan 2, 2026 with Super Formula Lights on four formula tracks. 113 hours were logged across 311 sessions before pivoting to GT3 on Feb 13, 2026. The SFL phase proved the methodology and infrastructure work. That data is archived.
